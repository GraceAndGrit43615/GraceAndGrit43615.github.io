            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>At Grace & Grit Defense Academy, our mission is to empower communities by equipping churches and daycare facilities with life-saving knowledge and skills through proven critical response techniques, guided by the values of ALERRT (Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training) and Citizen Response training. Rooted in core Christian values of compassion, service, and stewardship, we are driven by a heartfelt commitment to protect and serve others, inspired by our founders’ experiences—one as a United States Marine and the other as a Registered Nurse.</p>
            <p>Our Marine Corps background instills discipline, leadership, and a deep sense of duty, while our RN expertise brings a profound understanding of care, crisis management, and human resilience. Together, we leverage these strengths to deliver exceptional training, with a particular emphasis on our ALERRT Train-the-Trainer certification—a nationally recognized, research-based program trusted by law enforcement and civilians alike for its rigorous standards and proven effectiveness in preparing individuals to respond to critical incidents. This certification underscores our credibility and commitment to delivering the highest quality instruction.</p>
            <p>We are passionate about serving our community by offering this training at no cost to churches and daycare facilities, ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent access to essential preparedness education. Our initial goal is to educate as many local organizations as possible, fostering safer environments where faith and care thrive. At Grace & Grit Defense Academy, we believe that serving others is a calling, and we are dedicated to building stronger, more resilient communities through education, empowerment, and unwavering commitment to the greater good.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>“Trauma can't disappear, but it can be managed. You're entitled to scream, cry, break down, mourn and grieve, it's a part of healing.”</p>
                <footer>— Jackie Hegarty, Sandy Hook survivor</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I wish someone would have told me that everyone grieves differently and there is no correct way to work through your healing journey.”</p>
                <footer>— Dan Williams, Chardon High School survivor</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“Something I want to tell you, something I wish someone had told me, is that going through a school shooting is part of your history and part of your experiences, but it doesn't have to define you or become who you are.”</p>
                <footer>— Natalie Barden, Sandy Hook survivor</footer>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I encourage you to rock the boat. I encourage you to kick and scream and fight until they have no choice but to listen to you. Do whatever it takes.”</p>

            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
